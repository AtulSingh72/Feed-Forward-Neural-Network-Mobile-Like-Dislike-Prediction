# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network-Mobile-Like-Dislike-Prediction
This is a Feed Forward Neural Network Model designed to predict the User liking probability towards a Mobile Phone provided with its various technical specifictions.

The data for the project was downloaded from 91mobiles.com. The data consist of various features of mobiles of various build. Along with the feature set of the mobiles, Ratings given by the users has also been provided. Assuming that a Rating of greater than or equal to 4.0 indicates that the user will tend to like the product, the model has been implemented.

The model consists of a single hidden layer with 10 nodes. The activation function being used is the Sigmoid Activation Function and and the Gradient Decsent mechanism is Stochastic Gradient Descent. 

The maximum accuracy reached using this method was 88.88%.
